!!! info "About Display Scaling"

    When Windows display scaling (magnification setting) is set to 150%, the actual resolution of a 1920×1080 screen is 1280×720.

    By supporting [Per Monitor DPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/hidpi/high-dpi-desktop-application-development-on-windows), this software can be used comfortably even in 4K resolution or multi-monitor environments with different scaling settings.
