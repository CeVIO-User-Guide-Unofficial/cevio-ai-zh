!!! info "When shortcut keys don't work"

    The new MS IME will input text on screen when switching to the Japanese input method, and all shortcut keys will be invalid. A solution is to turn on Settings > General > Use previous version of Microsoft IME in the MS IME, then you can play/stop using the ++space++ key and input Japanese track names normally.

    Google IME will input characters when Japanese input is on (except in combination with the ++ctrl++ key), so please turn Japanese input off and then press the ++space++ key, or use the playback button on the toolbar directly.
