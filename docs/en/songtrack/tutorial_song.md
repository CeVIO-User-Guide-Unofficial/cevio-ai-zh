Place notes to create a melody, then input lyrics to create a natural singing voice.

With intuitive editing operations using the piano roll, you can also create multiple song tracks and make them chorus.

## 1. Start the application

After starting the application, the tracks will be displayed at the top of the screen.

If there are multiple tracks, click on the track name (or timeline) labeled "Song 1" to display the piano roll at the bottom of the screen.
