!!! warning

    As some of the official descriptions are vague, their original Japanese text has been retained until more official clarification is given.

CeVIO AI produces highly accurate Song Voices by learning recorded data labeled with the characteristic singing style of each voice provider. For some Song Voices, there is a possibility to bring out the characteristics of the voice by adding these labeling symbols to the lyrics in addition to falsetto.

\* Depending on the cast, lyrics, pitch, etc., the difficulty of showing the characteristics will vary.

\* Because it is a mechanism to improve the learning accuracy, there are cases where the characteristics do not appear.

\* Even if the characteristics are not defined (the field is empty), the input of symbols may cause some changes in the synthesized voice.
