CeVIO AI produces highly accurate Song Voices by learning from recorded data that's been labelled with the characteristic singing style of each voice provider. For some Song Voices, adding labelling symbols to the lyrics can enhance the unique characteristics of the voice, in addition to using falsetto.

\* The level of difficulty in showcasing certain characteristics can vary depending on factors such as the cast, lyrics, and pitch.

\* As the purpose of this mechanism is to enhance learning accuracy, there may be instances where the characteristics are not present.

\* It's possible for inputting symbols to induce changes in the synthesized voice, even when the characteristics have not been defined (i.e. the field is empty).
