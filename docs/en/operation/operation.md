The Talk Track will not be displayed in the environment where only the Song function is activated, such as the Song Starter Pack.

The environment where only one of Talk or Song function is activated will also have full functionality when you purchase and activate the other Starter Pack.

!!! example "Example from translator"

    Take the IA & ONE's CeVIO AI Series as an example. The starter pack contains the product keys of the Voice and the corresponding editor, for example, the OИE Talk Starter Pack includes the OИE Talk and the CeVIO Talk editor, a total of two product keys.

    ![IA & ONE's CeVIO Series](images/operation_2.png)

    - If only the OИE Talk Voice is purchased, the Talk function and Song function are not available due to the lack of the product key for activating the CeVIO editor.
    - If only the OИE Talk Starter Pack is purchased, the Talk function can be used normally, but the Song function is not available. on the basis of:
        - If you want to use IA's Talk Voice, since CeVIO's Talk editor is already activated, you only need to purchase IA's Talk Voice alone.
        - If you want to use OИE's Song Voice, you need to purchase OИE's Song Starter Pack and activate the editor together with the Song Voice. After activation, even if you only use OИE's Talk Voice to create in the future, the Song function will still be available.
    - If only the IA Song Starter Pack is purchased, the Song function can be used normally, but the Talk function is not available. on the basis of:
        - If you want to use OИE's Song Voice, same as above, just buy OИE's Song Voice.
        - If you want to use IA's Talk Voice, same as above, you need to purchase IA's Talk Starter Pack. After activation, the Talk function will still be available even if you only use IA's Song Voice to compose in the future.
        - If you want to use IA's English Song Voice, since Japanese and English share the same editor, you only need to purchase IA English Voice alone.
