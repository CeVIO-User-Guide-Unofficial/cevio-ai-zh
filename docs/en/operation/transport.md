### Goto Zero

Move the Cursor to the beginning. If the Start Marker is set, the cursor will move to the Start Marker first and then to the beginning.

### Start

Plays all tracks from the position cursor position.

(Mute tracks will not be played.)

### Stop

Stop playback. While stopping, it moves in order of playback start position and the beginning of the song by clicking "Stop" again.

### Circle

Enable or disable playback looping.

### Start Marker/End Marker

Set or remove the start/end point of playback looping.

The start/end point markers displayed in the ruler can be moved by dragging (hold down the left mouse button). If you hold down the ++alt++ key while dragging, the marker will automatically be attached to the closest second (or bar, depending on the time base of the ruler).

### Auto scroll

Automatically or Manually scroll timeline, speech list, piano roll during playback.

### Master Volume

You can adjust the overall volume while maintaining the volume balance between tracks.

Drag the knob left/right or up/down to adjust. Hold down the ++shift++ key while dragging for fine adjustment.

Press ++ctrl++ and left-click the knob to reset it to the default value (0db); double-click the knob to enter the value manually.

Master volume setting affects the listening, playback, and WAV export volume.

If the master volume is changed manually, it will be memorised and reflected in new projects.

\* +6 dB doubles the volume. Excessively high volumes will cause clipping.

### Position Cursor

Click on the ruler to move the cursor to that position.

Drag it left or right automatically moves the cursor in that direction. If you hold down the ++alt++ key while dragging and moving, the cursor will automatically be attached to the closest second (or bar, depending on the time base of the ruler).
