Whether dialogue or narration, you can use CeVIO to create the suitable sound.

With a single click, you can use emotion presets such as "元気一杯" and "哀しげ"[^1], and adjust the volume and speed in detail.

## 1. Start the application

After starting the application, the tracks will be displayed at the top of the screen.

\* If there are multiple tracks, click on the track name (or timeline) labeled "Talk 1" to display the talk editing screen at the bottom of the screen.
