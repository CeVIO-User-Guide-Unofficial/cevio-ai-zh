You can use the Word Registration function to register the correct pronunciation of the names of people or places that are easy to be mispronounced.

## Word Registration

Select "Word Registration" from the "Talk" menu, the right-click menu of the speech list or by right-clicking while entering a line.

(When multiple language Voices are in use, selecting an English Voice in the speech list.)

When a whole line is selected from the speech list, the selected sentence is used as the range for "Spelling"; when entering a line, the words within the range are selected.

### Spelling

Enter the spelling of the word to be registered in half-width alphabet (maximum 100 characters).

### Reading

Enter the pronunciation symbols of the word (maximum 100 characters).

Use `|` to separate syllables; use `,` to separate phonemes within a syllable.

The vowel should be followed by a number indicating stress (0 if omitted).

0: no stress 1: primary stress 2: secondary stress

### Continue to register

When it is on, click the "Register" button to move on to the next word. When it is off, registration ends when the button is pressed.

## User Dictionary Management

Select "Dictionary Management" from "Talk" menu allows you to edit or delete registered words.

Click on a column heading (Spelling/Reading) to temporarily reorder it.

### Edit and Delete Word

Double-click a word to edit.

Selected words can also be edited or deleted from the right-click menu.

The ++del++ key can delete the selected word, and the ++enter++ key can edit the selected word.

Hold down ++ctrl++ or ++shift++ to select multiple words, ++ctrl+a++ to select all words, and then delete all selected words.

### Search Word

Narrow the display to words that partially match the spelling or reading of the word.

OR search is used when entering multiple words separated by spaces. Wildcards (`*` and `?`) are allowed to use. For example, `Sa*` and `?a?ara` will match `Sasara`.

To transfer the user dictionary of registered words to another computer, please go to [FAQ](../faq/faq.md).
