### Listen

Listen to the currently selected line in the speech list. Press again to stop listening.

Left-click on a phoneme graph to listen to it from a specific position.

### Cycle

Enable or disable playback looping.

### Auto play

Toggle whether or not the lines are automatically played after they are entered or adjusted in the condition controller/emotion controller/phoneme graph.

If ["Partial replay with Phoneme Graph"](../../option/option/#partial-replay-with-phoneme-graph) is enable, the phoneme graph will automatic play the section from the previous pause before the adjustment point (e.g. punctuation) to the next pause after the adjustment point.

!!! tip "Use of auto play"

    Pressing ++enter++ after entering a line will automatically play the text of that line, so that it can be used in combination with "Continuous Input": input scripts in advance and play them back in sequence; as a real-time speech synthesis tool for live broadcasts; and so on.
