## Register Speech Clip

By registering the adjusted lines as speech clips, you can easily reuse them later.

The "Register Speech Clips" in the right-click menu allows you to register the lines of the selected row.

Conditions (volume to intonation), emotions, and phoneme graph adjustments are also registered.

You can register multiple different adjustments with the same line and use them properly, or you can overwrite the previous registration.
